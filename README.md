# Fake News Detection using NLP

![Fake News Detection](fake_news_detection.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project as part of the IBM AI Course AI101 for Naanmudhalvan. This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model that can distinguish between fake and real news articles.

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). It contains a collection of news articles labeled as either "fake" or "real," making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- Implement NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for fake news detection.
- Explore the use of LSTM and BERT-based models for improved accuracy.
- Create an ensemble model that combines the strengths of different architectures.
- Provide a robust fake news detection system that can be used as a valuable tool for media literacy.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and feature engineering.
3. **LSTM Model**: Implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for fake news detection.
4. **BERT Model**: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for text classification.
5. **Ensemble Model**: Create an ensemble model that combines predictions from multiple models.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and analyze their performance.
7. **Deployment**: If required, deploy the best-performing model for practical use.
